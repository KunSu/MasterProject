       " 'ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECT MANAGER PRINCIPAL#1: IN THE ABSENCE OF A GREAT LEADER ALL IS LOST\\xa0The attraction in the case of this particular position and location, beyond solid money, beautiful surroundings and windfall possibilities on realty, is the team and the Division Manager in particular. \\xa0We are a national company and are working coast-to-coast. The company needs a Project Manager to team with the sharpest and pragmatically aggressive Division manager working in the nation, giving consideration to all locations and operations coast-to-coast. The focus and aggressive posture of our Division Manager does not take away from personal good nature or reason. This particular Division Manager has a career history of innovative marketing, an uncanny ability to interpret client needs, and an equally impressive capacity for reading political climate. \\xa0His instincts for the identification of and skills in reaching decision making authorities within Fortune 100 corporations are legendary. This Division Manager possesses impeccable client service skills, and remarkable risk assessment and risk management skills. This is a construction professional that can walk into a meeting cold, read the room, and engage without misstep. As an electrical construction management professional you will find yourself willingly dragging the boss into your toughest circumstances and darkest moments with confidence; an exceptional person as much as an exceptional electrical construction professional.The proof of all these claims has been simple to evaluate: In the toughest electrical construction economy in the Nation, this particular leader has done as well or better than old entrenched Business Unit Managers many of whom had the benefit of fifty-plus years of annuity client history in their divisions. This Division Manager is going to build a sub-empire. There is a lot to be learned from a leader you will respect and a professional person that will actually be fun to work with. We have yet to find a committed professional that does not quickly grow to respect the Division Manager. Finally; the Division Manager is humble and makes sure that every team member is seen for what they have done, and makes sure contributors are paid for what they have accomplished. Talking credit for the brilliance and hard work of others on the team: NEVER. Allowing others to take blame for problems associated with decisions he has made or authorizations he has provided: NEVER. NEVER. \\xa0PRINCIPAL#2: MULTITASKING IS TOUGHER BUT PAYS OUT MORE QUICKLY AND GENERALLY BETTER.\\xa0The Division is a service based division and the Project Manager will routinely run half a dozen or more jobs that range in value from $10K - $1 million.\\xa0It is difficult to track and manage clients and administration on multiple projects. It is always easier to run one ten-million dollar job than ten one-million dollar jobs and the company is keenly aware of that. The professional the firm seeks, however, is that highly disciplined administrative warrior that can juggle multiple inputs and outputs. \\xa0The comments about pay-out and overall compensation relate to the facts that smaller jobs complete and flush out their financial results more rapidly, often carry higher margins, and bonus is based on division and personal results. A professional that can consistently manage multiple, smaller fast-track projects is far more likely to have the stronger bottom line and quicker path to close out than a PM running a huge job where there is the potential for years in construction.PRINCIPAL#3: THE BEST SYSTEMS, TOOLS, TECHNOLOGIES AND RESOURCES WINWe are one of the very largest engineering driven EPC firms in the nation. While all of that seems remote from managing small fast-track commercial and institutional electrical constructions, it is really not. Best in nation materials pricing, best in nation prefabrication capability, best in nation risk management, best in nation proposal and contracts development; these are systems and services you will tap working in our system. Fully evolved construction tracking, scheduling and financial management IT tools will be taught to you and will make that juggling multiple projects much easier. Unlimited bonding, cash reserves, physical locations to support national efforts, detail engineering, full BIM engineering; these are rabbits you will pull at some point. Best in nation internal engineering for utility power, general electrical power, communications, security, fire alarm and other specialized systems integrations: All in your tool bag. Having massive, best-in-nation support systems at your disposal and at the disposal of clients’ will work to your advantage even at the most local level. A national track record for success spanning more than five decades helps as well.THE JOB:This is the classic electrical small constructions PM with the exception that projects will be tracked in state of the art IT systems and the Company expects a level of control and administrative excellence that is atypical.    The PM will review the work of estimating to make sure the voice of operations is heard and there is buy-in.    The PM may either develop a simple budget and schedule for a small job, or may be required to complete AIA documents to intelligently schedule values for a larger job.    The PM will work with purchasing on large and specialized buy outs.    The PM will receive production information from the field superintendents.    The PM will read the minds of the superintendents and where there is no clarity; walk the jobs to make certain that construction reporting matches physical realities. Superintendents that lie will not be around long.    The PM will serve as liaison to the client.    The PM will oversee coordination with other trades and subcontractors.    The PM will manage the change order process from estimating to the signatures that need to be collected before work starts. That pain (getting the deal sealed) is always smaller and simpler right up front.    The PM will keep really well organizing notes, records and pictures as that seems wise so that meetings can be controlled, client issues can be answered, relationships with aggressive general constructors can be managed, and if all else fails, well supported claims may be filed.SKILLS NEEDED TO PERFORM THE JOB    Skills in the interpretation of RFPs, contract documents and drawings.    Skills in interpreting loose client inputs – sometime just verbal inputs that must be converted into a proposed scope.     Estimating (primarily for operational review and scope/change order management).    Experience with the advantageous management of AIA documents. An example is the establishment and maintenance of positive cash flow using the schedule of values to get cash in as early into the project as possible.    And understanding of critical path methodology scheduling. We do not need a Primavera genius (although that is always nice), but that logical thought process is important.    The experience of employing a comprehensive quantitative reporting system for project tracking inside an overall enterprise resource management system. Simply put: Everything gets into a system.    Personal technical electrical construction acumen.    Experience in the management of trades coordination and coordination negotiations.    Administrative excellence which includes the reflexive documentation of changing conditions, preemptive claim detail and document assembly, the formal proposal and receipt of acknowledgement (in writing) for client requested changes and scope creep that constitutes grounds for change orders.    Strength in professional communications. Strong command of business language, excellence in verbal exchange, strong professional writing skills.    IT tools strength. Willingness to employ IT as a fundamental management tool and strength as a user.     Broad construction acumen supporting excellence in coordination issue management and the ability to drive a schedule and positively position the interests of the electrical constructor.
